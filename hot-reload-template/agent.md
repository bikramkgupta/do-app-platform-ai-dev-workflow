# Agent Playbook: Deploy a User App with This Dev Template

Docs map: `README.md` = how humans use it, `CUSTOMIZATION.md` = how to fork/extend it, `AGENT.md` = how an agent wires it up end-to-end.

**Essential Reference:** See [`App_Platform_Commands.md`](App_Platform_Commands.md) for all `doctl` commands needed for deployment, monitoring, and debugging.

## What to Collect from the User

- App repo URL (and GitHub token if private).
- Startup plan: preferred `DEV_START_COMMAND` (default `bash dev_startup.sh`) or confirm repo already has `dev_startup.sh`/`startup.sh`.
- Runtimes to install via build args (`INSTALL_NODE/PYTHON/GOLANG/RUST`, DB clients).
- Health check choice: default `/dev_health` on port `9090` is for first deploy only (built-in Go binary, always available); plan to point checks to the app's endpoint/port and disable the built-in server afterward via `ENABLE_DEV_HEALTH=false`.
- App name/region/size (for `app.yaml`), sync interval if they want non-default.

## Execution Flow (Keep It Short)

1) **Verify access:** Ensure `doctl` is authenticated; optionally check `gh auth status` if you need repo management.  
2) **Set expectations:** Remind the user this template container clones their app repo and runs it; code lives in their repo, not here.  
3) **Fill config:** Edit `app.yaml` (or App Platform UI):
   - Build args for runtimes/clients.
   - Envs: `GITHUB_REPO_URL`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` (SECRET), `DEV_START_COMMAND` or rely on repo script, optional `GITHUB_SYNC_INTERVAL`, `WORKSPACE_PATH`.  
   - Health check: keep `/dev_health` on `9090` unless the user prefers their own.
   - Verify that deploy-on-push is NOT enabled. If it is enabled (true), then every git commit will result in app being re-deployed, which is NOT what we want.
   - If the component is static_site, it will not work. Because the hot reload requires a container, and static site is deployed to Spaces object store. Only services and workers type components will work.
4) **Deploy:** `doctl apps create --spec app.yaml` (or update existing). If using the DO button/UI, enter the same values.  
5) **Verify:** Hit health endpoint, check logs (`doctl apps logs <app-id> --type run`), and confirm git sync pulls changes. Note that you can check the latest commit in the logs. For deeper container inspection, use the remote exec tool (see `App_Platform_Commands.md` → "Execute commands in running containers").

## Smart Defaults

- `DEV_START_COMMAND="bash dev_startup.sh"`; repo `dev_startup.sh`/`startup.sh` is used if present and `DEV_START_COMMAND` is empty.
- Built-in `/dev_health` (lightweight Go binary, ~2MB) is just a bootstrap aid. Move health to the app, set `ENABLE_DEV_HEALTH=false`, and disable unused runtimes for smaller images.
- App listens on `8080`; health server listens on `9090`.
- Sync interval: `30` seconds unless the user asks otherwise.

## Reminders

- Git pulls do **not** restart the app; the user’s dev server should handle reloads, or they must restart the container after dependency changes.
- Keep tokens as secrets; never commit them. Confirm before creating repos or pushing code.
- For deeper template changes (new runtimes, custom sync/health), hand off to `CUSTOMIZATION.md`.
